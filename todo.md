Part 3: Expanded Library Management System
Now, let’s discuss the more complex aspects of your Library Management System (LMS):

Books Module:

Store books with attributes like title, author, category, and availability status (borrowed/available).
Implement relationships between Book and Author.
Use RESTful API endpoints to allow CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for books.
Entities: Book, Author, Category

Features:

List all available books.
Allow users to search for books by title, author, or category.
Enable users to borrow and return books, updating availability status.
Users and Roles:

Role-based access control where Librarians can manage books and users, while Members can only borrow/return books.
Entities: User, Role

Features:

User management system (admin can create librarians or members).
Access control where only authorized roles can manage books or users.
Borrow and Return System:

When a user borrows a book, the system should store the borrow date and expected return date.
Implement a mechanism to track overdue books and notify users of upcoming due dates (use cron jobs or queue system).
Entities: BorrowTransaction

Features:

Record when books are borrowed/returned and update availability status.
Automatic reminders for overdue books using cron jobs.
Cron Job for Notifications:

Use Redis or a queue system like RabbitMQ to schedule background jobs.
For example, send an email reminder 2 days before the book's due date.
Tools: Spring Boot Scheduler or Spring Batch.

Advanced Search:

Implement a search functionality with filters for categories, availability, and author.
Reports:

Librarians should be able to generate reports for borrowed books, overdue books, and book categories.

Next Steps
Books and Author Module: Define the Book and Author entities, and create API endpoints for managing books.
Borrow and Return System: Design how borrowing transactions will be handled, including notifications for overdue books.
Cron Job Setup: Use Redis for managing the job queue or schedule with Spring’s @Scheduled annotation.
Role-Based Access Control: Set up permissions for different user roles like Librarian and Member.
